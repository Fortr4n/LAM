# Large Action Model (LAM) - A Transparent Exploration

> **Because Let's Be Honest, this is what Rabbit should've made**

This repository explores the true potential of Large Action Models (LAMs), unlike the recent... well, let's just say the Rabbit R1 wasn't exactly hopping mad with functionality.

## üöÄ What a Real LAM Could Do (Besides Look Cute on Your Counter)

Imagine a LAM that's less like a glorified Alexa in a bunny suit and more like your personal robot butler. We're talking:

- **üçï Actually getting you food** - Real DoorDash integration
- **üöó Actually getting you a ride** - Real Uber integration  
- **üè® Actually booking your travel** - Real Expedia integration
- **üí∞ Actually managing your finances** - Real Plaid integration
- **üß† Actually understanding context** - Advanced AI with emotion recognition
- **üîí Actually protecting your privacy** - Homomorphic encryption for tasks

But if I'm being honest, LAM should actually be called **ALLM** or **LLM-A** for Actionable LLM because that's essentially what it is - at least it's what's being presented/discovered.

## üê∞ The Rabbit R1 - More Hype Than Hop

The R1 sparked a lot of discussion, but some might say it was more like a baby bunny learning to walk ‚Äì a bit wobbly and unsure of itself. Here's why the R1 might not be the LAM champion:

- **Limited Action Moves:** More like a "Slightly More Animated Paperweight" Model
- **Privacy Concerns:** Is the R1 phoning home a little too much? Maybe it just misses its cardboard box origins
- **Too Ambitious:** While the tests yielded interesting findings, for something mass market, trying to get around captcha shouldn't be an afterthought

## üéØ So Why This Repository?

- **To dream about what LAMs can truly do**
- **To champion responsible AI development** ‚Äì because with great power comes great responsibility, even for bunnies
- **To (hopefully) temper some expectations** regarding these AI hardware assistants
- **To provide a working example** of what's possible with current technology

```python
from agent import Agent
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create agent
agent = Agent("My Assistant")

# Add tasks
agent.add_task("Meeting at 3 PM", priority=1, 
               due_time=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=2))

# Generate AI response
response = agent.generate_response("What should I do today?")

# Record and analyze audio
transcription = agent.record_and_transcribe_audio(duration=5)
emotion = agent.recognize_emotion(transcription)

# Use real-world APIs
agent.order_food("New York")
agent.request_ride(40.7128, -74.0060, 40.730610, -73.935242)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Model Settings
```python
from config import Config

# Customize AI models
Config.TEXT_MODEL_NAME = "your-preferred-model"
Config.SPEECH_MODEL_NAME = "your-speech-model"
Config.EMOTION_MODEL_NAME = "your-emotion-model"

# Audio settings
Config.DEFAULT_AUDIO_DURATION = 10
Config.DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE = 22050
```

### API Configuration
```python
# Check API status
Config.print_config_status()

# Validate keys
validation = Config.validate_api_keys()
missing = Config.get_missing_api_keys()
```
